                            In a typical React application, data is passed top-down <code>(parent to child)</code> via props, <br /> but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props <code>(e.g. locale preference, UI theme)</code> that are required by many components <br /> within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components <br /> without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

                            A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of non-semantic elements:
                            <code> div and span  </code>
                            - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements:
                            <code> `"form , table , and article `" </code>
                            Clearly defines its content

                        In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <code>li</code> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?

                        React.createContext() is all you need. It returns a consumer and a provider. Provider is a component that as it's names suggests provides the state to its children. It will hold the "store" and be the parent of all the components that might need that store. Consumer as it so happens is a component that consumes and uses the state.
